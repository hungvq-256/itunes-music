# itunes-music
This is an application that can search for songs on iTunes, it uses the ReactJS library to build the UI and Redux to manage the state. When searching for a song, the results will be displayed in a list, and we can view detailed information by clicking on it and listen to a demo by hover on big image.
This app use react-library-testing to test. This is my first time writing unit tests, so it's quite simple and may not cover all cases. I am trying to improve my unit testing skills.
